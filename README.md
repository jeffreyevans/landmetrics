# landmetrics 0.1-0
Legacy landscape metrics

landmetrics R package with utilities to support analysis of landscpae pattern
  legacy functions and C++ code from the spatialEco package
    
# Available functions in landmetrics 0.1-0 are:

    focal.lmetrics - Landscape metrics using a focal window
 
    land.metrics - Calculates a variety of landscape metrics, on binary rasters, for polygons or points with a buffer 
                  distance. This is similar to the moving window in Fragstats but, uses either a buffer for each 
                  point or a zonal approach with polygons, to derive local metrics.
